            This video is my best effort to show in a simple way how Robin-hood.net will one day work. It has hopeful predictions for the money that it could generate and the estimated costs to build have changed.

        <h5>There are 2.2 billion children in the world; 1 billion live in poverty (every second child)</h5>
        <ul class="browser-default">
            <li>640 million live without adequate shelter (1 in 3)</li>
            <li>400 million live with no access to safe water (1 in 5)</li>
            <li>270 million live with no access to health services (1 in 7)</li>
            <li>10.6 million died in 2003 before they reached the age of 5</li>
            <li>1.4 million die each year from lack of access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation</li>
            <li>2.2 million children die each year because they are not immunized</li>
            <li>15 million children orphaned due to HIV/AIDS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We as merry men visit Robin-Hood.net, bringing the daily "unique visit counter" up. It costs us only a minute of our time-a span in which 15 children will starve to death according to <a href="http://www.globalissues.org" rel="external" class="link-alt">www.globalissues.org</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The wealthy travelers who come through the forest have put some of their advertising budget into an account that robin-hood.net can access. The more merry men who visit the forest, the more money R-H will transfer from those accounts at the end of each month. These Travelers will be paying by far the lowest price for impressions on the internet and no charge for click ins.  We must treat these wealthy travelers like kings for without them there would be no forest.  So visit their sites and use their services.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com" rel="external" class="link-alt">www.internetworldstats.com</a> there is over 2 billion internet users world wide. If one-half of 1 percent of them joins Robin’s band of merry men and visits once a day, then children suffering will see another 100+ million USD of help each year. It is hopeful to think that one day 10% of all internet users will feel charitable enough to donate 1 min of their time each day to visit.
        </p>
        <p>
            People and organizations from all parts of the world will submit their favorite charities. Their information will be sent to a charity watch organization (Ex; <a href="http://www.charitywatch.org" rel="external" class="link-alt">www.charitywatch.org</a> ) to be verified and graded for good work and responsible stewardship. Then they will be placed on Robin-Hood.net’s list of Charities with an ID # that R-H.net can verify.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of each month, R-H will transfer all the money it draws out of the Travelers accounts into the accounts of the charities on the list. R-H’s server fees, which will be minimal, will be its only overhead expense.
        </p>
        <p>At the end of every month Robin-Hood.net will be flat broke and repeat its programming. Everyone will benefit.</p>
